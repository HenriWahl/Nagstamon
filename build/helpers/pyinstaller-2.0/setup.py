"""
PyInstaller is a program that converts (packages) Python programs into
stand-alone executables, under Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. Its main
advantages over similar tools are that PyInstaller works with any
version of Python since 2.2, it builds smaller executables thanks to
transparent compression, it is fully multi-platform, and use the OS
support to load the dynamic libraries, thus ensuring full
compatibility.

The main goal of PyInstaller is to be compatible with 3rd-party
packages out-of-the-box. This means that, with PyInstaller, all the
required tricks to make external packages work are already integrated
within PyInstaller itself so that there is no user intervention
required. You'll never be required to look for tricks in wikis and
apply custom modification to your files or your setup scripts. As an
example, libraries like PyQt, Django or matplotlib are fully
supported, without having to handle plugins or external data files
manually.
