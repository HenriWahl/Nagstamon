Description: =======================================
        Installing and Using Python Keyring Lib
        =======================================
        
        .. contents:: **Table of Contents**
        
        ---------------------------
        What is Python keyring lib?
        ---------------------------
        
        The Python keyring lib provides a easy way to access the system keyring service
        from python. It can be used in any application that needs safe password storage.
        
        The keyring library is licensed under both the `MIT license
        <http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_ and the PSF license.
        
        The keyring services supported by the Python keyring lib:
        
        * **OSXKeychain**: supports the Keychain service in Mac OS X.
        * **KDEKWallet**: supports the KDE's Kwallet service.
        * **GnomeKeyring**: for Gnome 2 environment.
        * **SecretServiceKeyring**: for newer GNOME and KDE environments.
        * **WinVaultKeyring**: supports the Windows Credential Vault
        
        Besides these native password storing services provided by operating systems.
        Python keyring lib also provides following build-in keyrings.
        
        * **Win32CryptoKeyring**: for Windows 2k+.
        * **CryptedFileKeyring**: a command line interface keyring base on PyCrypto.
        * **UncryptedFileKeyring**: a keyring which leaves passwords directly in file.
        
        -------------------------
        Installation Instructions
        -------------------------
        
        easy_install or pip
        ===================
        
        Run easy_install or pip::
        
            $ easy_install keyring
            $ pip install keyring
        
        Source installation
        ===================
        
        Download the source tarball, and uncompress it, then run the install command::
        
            $ wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/k/keyring/keyring-0.3.tar.gz
            $ tar -xzvf keyring-0.3.tar.gz
            $ cd keyring-0.3
            $ python setup.py install
        
        
        -------------
        Using Keyring
        -------------
        
        The basic usage of keyring is pretty simple: just call `keyring.set_password`
        and `keyring.get_password`:
        
            >>> import keyring
            >>> keyring.set_password("system", "username", "password")
            >>> keyring.get_password("system", "username")
            'password'
        
        --------------------------
        Configure your keyring lib
        --------------------------
        
        The python keyring lib contains implementations for several backends, including
        **OSX Keychain**, **Gnome Keyring**, **KDE Kwallet** and etc. The lib will
        automatically choose the keyring that is most suitable for your current
        environment. You can also specify the keyring you like to be used in the config
        file or by calling the ``set_keyring()`` function.
        
        Customize your keyring by config file
        =====================================
        
        This section is about how to change your option in the config file.
        
        Config file path
        ----------------
        
        The configuration of the lib is stored in a file named "keyringrc.cfg". This
        file must be found in a platform-specific location. To determine
        where the config file is stored, run the following::
        
            python -c "import keyring.util.platform_; print(keyring.util.platform_.config_root())"
        
        Some keyrings also store the keyring data in the file system. To determine
        where the data files are stored, run this command::
        
            python -c "import keyring.util.platform_; print(keyring.util.platform_.data_root())"
        
        
        Config file content
        -------------------
        
        To specify a keyring backend, you need tell the lib the module name of the
        backend, such as ``keyring.backends.OS_X.Keyring``. If the backend is not
        shipped
        with the lib, in another word, is made by you own, you need also tell the lib
        the path of your own backend module. The module name should be written after the
        **default-keyring** option, while the module path belongs the **keyring-path**
        option.
        
        Here's a sample config file(The full demo can be accessed in the ``demo/keyring.py``):
        ::
        
            [backend]
            default-keyring=simplekeyring.SimpleKeyring
            keyring-path=/home/kang/pyworkspace/python-keyring-lib/demo/
        
        
        Write your own keyring backend
        ==============================
        
        The interface for the backend is defined by ``keyring.backend.KeyringBackend``.
        By extending this base class and implementing the three functions
        ``supported()``, ``get_password()`` and ``set_password()``, you can easily create
        your own backend for keyring lib.
        
        The usage of the three functions:
        
        * ``supported(self)`` : Return if this backend is supported in current
          environment. The returned value can be **0**, **1** , or **-1**. **0** means
          suitable; **1** means recommended and **-1** means this backend is not
          available for current environment.
        * ``get_password(self, service, username)`` : Return the stored password for the
          ``username`` of the ``service``.
        * ``set_password(self, service, username, password)`` : Store the ``password``
          for ``username`` of the ``service`` in the backend.
        * ``delete_password(self, service, username)`` : Delete the stored password for
          the ``username`` of the ``service``.
        
        For an instance, there's the source code of the demo mentioned above. It's a
        simple keyring which stores the password directly in memory.
        
        ::
        
            """
            simplekeyring.py

            """
            from keyring.backend import KeyringBackend
        
            class SimpleKeyring(KeyringBackend):
                """Simple Keyring is a keyring which can store only one
                password in memory.
                """
                def __init__(self):
                    self.password = ''
        
                def supported(self):
                    return 0
        
                def get_password(self, service, username):
                    return self.password
        
                def set_password(self, service, username, password):
                    self.password = password
                    return 0
        
                def delete_password(self, service, username):
                    self.password = None
        
        
        Set the keyring in runtime
        ==========================
        
        Besides setting the backend through the config file, you can also set the
        backend to use by calling the api ``set_keyring()``. The backend you passed in
        will be used to store the password in your application.
        
        Here's a code snippet from the ``keyringdemo.py``. It shows the usage of
        ``set_keyring()``
        ::
        
            # define a new keyring class which extends the KeyringBackend
            import keyring.backend
            class TestKeyring(keyring.backend.KeyringBackend):
                """A test keyring which always outputs same password
                """
                def supported(self): return 0
                def set_password(self, servicename, username, password): return 0
                def get_password(self, servicename, username):
                    return "password from TestKeyring"
                def delete_password(self, servicename, username, password): return 0
        
            # set the keyring for keyring lib
            import keyring
            keyring.set_keyring(TestKeyring())
        
            # invoke the keyring lib
            try:
                keyring.set_password("demo-service", "tarek", "passexample")
                print "password stored sucessfully"
            except keyring.backend.PasswordSetError:
                print "failed to store password"
            print "password", keyring.get_password("demo-service", "tarek")

        Integrate the keyring lib with your application
        -----------------------------------------------
        
        API interface
        =============
        
        The keyring lib has a few functions:
        
        * ``get_keyring()`` : Return the currently-loaded keyring implementation.
        * ``get_password(service, username)`` : Returns the password stored in keyring.
          If the password does not exist, it will return None.
        * ``set_password(service, username, password)`` : Store the password in the
          keyring.
        * ``delete_password(service, username)`` : Delete the password stored in
          keyring. If the password does not exist, it will raise an exception.
        
        Example
        =======
        
        Here's an example of using keyring for application authorization. It can be
        found in the demo folder of the repository. Note that the faked auth function
        only returns true when the password equals to the username.

        Running Tests
        =============
        
        Tests are `continuously run <https://travis-ci.org/#!/jaraco/keyring>`_ using
        Travis-CI.
        
        |BuildStatus|_
        
        .. |BuildStatus| image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/jaraco/keyring.png
        .. _BuildStatus: http://travis-ci.org/jaraco/keyring
        
        To run the tests yourself, you'll want keyring installed to some environment
        in which it can be tested. Three recommended techniques are described below.
        
        Using pytest runner
        -------------------
        
        Keyring is instrumented with `pytest runner
        <https://bitbucket.org/jaraco/pytest-runner>`_. Thus, you may invoke the tests
        from any supported Python (with distribute installed) using this command::
        
            python setup.py ptr
        
        pytest runner will download any unmet dependencies and run the tests using
        `pytest <https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/pytest>`_.
        
        This technique is the one used by the Travis-CI script.
        
        Using virtualenv and pytest/nose/unittest2
        ------------------------------------------
        
        Pytest and Nose are two popular test runners that will discover tests and run
        them. Unittest (unittest2 under Python 2.6) also has a mode
        to discover tests.
        
        First, however, these test runners typically need a test environment in which
        to run. It is recommended that you install keyring to a virtual environment
        to avoid interfering with your system environment. For more information, see
        the `virtualenv homepage <http://www.virtualenv.org>`_.
        
        After you've created (or designated) your environment, install keyring into
        the environment by running::
        
            python setup.py develop
        
        Then, invoke your favorite test runner, e.g.::
        
            py.test
        
        or::
        
            nosetests
        
        Using buildout
        --------------
        
        Keyring supplies a buildout.cfg for use with buildout. If you have buildout
        installed, tests can be invoked as so::
        
            1. bin/buildout  # prepare the buildout.
            2. bin/test  # execute the test runner.
        
        For more information about the options that the script provides do execute::
        
            python bin/test --help

           - Correctly escape item name when removing.
           - Use with statement when working with files.
        
        * Add a test for removing one item in group.
        
        * Issue #81: Added experimental support for third-party backends. See
          `keyring.core._load_library_extensions` for information on supplying
          a third-party backend.
        
        ---
        3.1
        ---
        
        * All code now runs natively on both Python 2 and Python 3, no 2to3 conversion
          is required.
        * Testsuite: clean up, and make more use of unittest2 methods.

        * Issue #114: Fix logic in pyfs detection.
        
        -----
        3.0.4
        -----
        
        * Issue #114: Fix detection of pyfs under Mercurial Demand Import.
        
        -----
        3.0.3
        -----
        
        * Simplified the implementation of ``keyring.core.load_keyring``. It now uses
          ``__import__`` instead of loading modules explicitly. The ``keyring_path``
          parameter to ``load_keyring`` is now deprecated. Callers should instead
          ensure their module is available on ``sys.path`` before calling
          ``load_keyring``. Keyring still honors ``keyring-path``. This change fixes
          Issue #113 in which the explicit module loading of keyring modules was
          breaking package-relative imports.
        
        -----
        3.0.2
        -----
        
        * Renamed ``keyring.util.platform`` to ``keyring.util.platform_``. As reported
          in Issue #112 and `mercurial_keyring #31
          <https://bitbucket.org/Mekk/mercurial_keyring/issue/31>`_ and in `Mercurial
          itself <http://bz.selenic.com/show_bug.cgi?id=4029>`_, Mercurial's Demand
          Import does not honor ``absolute_import`` directives, so it's not possible
          to have a module with the same name as another top-level module. A patch is
          in place to fix this issue upstream, but to support older Mercurial
          versions, this patch will remain for some time.
        
        -----
        3.0.1
        -----
        
        * Ensure that modules are actually imported even in Mercurial's Demand Import
          environment.
        
        ---
        3.0
        ---
        
        * Removed support for Python 2.5.
        * Removed names in ``keyring.backend`` moved in 1.1 and previously retained
          for compatibilty.
        
        -----
        2.1.1
        -----
        
        * Restored Python 2.5 compatibility (lost in 2.0).
        
        ---
        2.1
        ---
        
        *  Issue #10: Added a 'store' attribute to the OS X Keyring, enabling custom
           instances of the KeyringBackend to use another store, such as the
           'internet' store. For example::
        
               keys = keyring.backends.OS_X.Keyring()
               keys.store = 'internet'
               keys.set_password(system, user, password)
               keys.get_password(system, user)
        
           The default for all instances can be set in the class::
        
               keyring.backends.OS_X.Keyring.store = 'internet'
        
        *  GnomeKeyring: fix availability checks, and make sure the warning
           message from pygobject is not printed.
        
        *  Fixes to GnomeKeyring and SecretService tests.
        
        -----
        2.0.3
        -----
        
        *  Issue #112: Backend viability/priority checks now are more aggressive about
           module presence checking, requesting ``__name__`` from imported modules to
           force the demand importer to actually attempt the import.

        -----
        
        *  Issue #110: Fix issues with ``Windows.RegistryKeyring``.
        
        ---
        2.0
        ---
        
        *  Issue #80: Prioritized backend support. The primary interface for Keyring
           backend classes has been refactored to now emit a 'priority' based on the
           current environment (operating system, libraries available, etc). These
           priorities provide an indication of the applicability of that backend for
           the current environment. Users are still welcome to specify a particular
           backend in configuration, but the default behavior should now be to select
           the most appropriate backend by default.
        
        -----
        1.6.1
        -----
        
        * Only include pytest-runner in 'setup requirements' when ptr invocation is
          indicated in the command-line (Issue #105).
        
        ---
        1.6
        ---
        
        *  GNOME Keyring backend:
        
           - Use the same attributes (``username`` / ``service``) as the SecretService
             backend uses, allow searching for old ones for compatibility.
           - Also set ``application`` attribute.
           - Correctly handle all types of errors, not only ``CANCELLED`` and ``NO_MATCH``.
           - Avoid printing warnings to stderr when GnomeKeyring is not available.
        
        * Secret Service backend:
        
           - Use a better label for passwords, the same as GNOME Keyring backend uses.
        
        ---
        1.5
        ---
        
        *  SecretService: allow deleting items created using previous python-keyring
           versions.
        
           Before the switch to secretstorage, python-keyring didn't set "application"
           attribute. Now in addition to supporting searching for items without that
           attribute, python-keyring also supports deleting them.
        
        *  Use ``secretstorage.get_default_collection`` if it's available.
        
           On secretstorage 1.0 or later, python-keyring now tries to create the
           default collection if it doesn't exist, instead of just raising the error.
        
        *  Improvements for tests, including fix for Issue #102.
        
        ---
        1.4
        ---
        
        * Switch GnomeKeyring backend to use native libgnome-keyring via
          GObject Introspection, not the obsolete python-gnomekeyring module.
        
        ---
        1.3
        ---
        
        * Use the `SecretStorage library <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SecretStorage>`_
          to implement the Secret Service backend (instead of using dbus directly).
          Now the keyring supports prompting for and deleting passwords. Fixes #69,
          #77, and #93.
        * Catch `gnomekeyring.IOError` per the issue `reported in Nova client
          <https://bugs.launchpad.net/python-novaclient/+bug/1116302>`_.
        * Issue #92 Added support for delete_password on Mac OS X Keychain.
        
        -----
        1.2.3
        -----
        
        * Fix for Encrypted File backend on Python 3.
        * Issue #97 Improved support for PyPy.
        
        -----
        1.2.2
        -----
        
        * Fixed handling situations when user cancels kwallet dialog or denies access
          for the app.
        
        -----
        1.2.1
        -----
        
        * Fix for kwallet delete.
        * Fix for OS X backend on Python 3.
        * Issue #84: Fix for Google backend on Python 3 (use of raw_input not caught
          by 2to3).
        
        ---
        1.2
        ---
        
        * Implemented delete_password on most keyrings. Keyring 2.0 will require
          delete_password to implement a Keyring. Fixes #79.
        
        -----
        1.1.2
        -----
        
        * Issue #78: pyfilesystem backend now works on Windows.
        
        -----
        1.1.1
        -----
        
        * Fixed MANIFEST.in so .rst files are included.
        
        ---
        1.1
        ---
        
        This is the last build that will support installation in a pure-distutils
        mode. Subsequent releases will require setuptools/distribute to install.
        Python 3 installs have always had this requirement (for 2to3 install support),
        but starting with the next minor release (1.2+), setuptools will be required.
        
        Additionally, this release has made some substantial refactoring in an
        attempt to modularize the backends. An attempt has been made to maintain 100%
        backward-compatibility, although if your library does anything fancy with
        module structure or clasess, some tweaking may be necessary. The
        backward-compatible references will be removed in 2.0, so the 1.1+ releases
        represent a transitional implementation which should work with both legacy
        and updated module structure.
        
        * Added a console-script 'keyring' invoking the command-line interface.
        * Deprecated _ExtensionKeyring.
        * Moved PasswordSetError and InitError to an `errors` module (references kept
          for backward-compatibility).
        * Moved concrete backend implementations into their own modules (references
          kept for backward compatibility):
        
          - OSXKeychain -> backends.OS_X.Keyring
          - GnomeKeyring -> backends.Gnome.Keyring
          - SecretServiceKeyring -> backends.SecretService.Keyring
          - KDEKWallet -> backends.kwallet.Keyring
          - BasicFileKeyring -> backends.file.BaseKeyring
          - CryptedFileKeyring -> backends.file.EncryptedKeyring
          - UncryptedFileKeyring -> backends.file.PlaintextKeyring
          - Win32CryptoKeyring -> backends.Windows.EncryptedKeyring
          - WinVaultKeyring -> backends.Windows.WinVaultKeyring
          - Win32CryptoRegistry -> backends.Windows.RegistryKeyring
          - select_windows_backend -> backends.Windows.select_windows_backend
          - GoogleDocsKeyring -> backends.Google.DocsKeyring
          - Credential -> keyring.credentials.Credential
          - BaseCredential -> keyring.credentials.SimpleCredential
          - EnvironCredential -> keyring.credentials.EnvironCredential
          - GoogleEnvironCredential -> backends.Google.EnvironCredential
          - BaseKeyczarCrypter -> backends.keyczar.BaseCrypter
          - KeyczarCrypter -> backends.keyczar.Crypter
          - EnvironKeyczarCrypter -> backends.keyczar.EnvironCrypter
          - EnvironGoogleDocsKeyring -> backends.Google.KeyczarDocsKeyring
          - BasicPyfilesystemKeyring -> backends.pyfs.BasicKeyring
          - UnencryptedPyfilesystemKeyring -> backends.pyfs.PlaintextKeyring
          - EncryptedPyfilesystemKeyring -> backends.pyfs.EncryptedKeyring
          - EnvironEncryptedPyfilesystemKeyring -> backends.pyfs.KeyczarKeyring
          - MultipartKeyringWrapper -> backends.multi.MultipartKeyringWrapper
        
        * Officially require Python 2.5 or greater (although unofficially, this
          requirement has been in place since 0.10).
        
        ---
        1.0
        ---
        
        This backward-incompatible release attempts to remove some cruft from the
        codebase that's accumulated over the versions.
        
        * Removed legacy file relocation support. `keyring` no longer supports loading
          configuration or file-based backends from ~. If upgrading from 0.8 or later,
          the files should already have been migrated to their new proper locations.
          If upgrading from 0.7.x or earlier, the files will have to be migrated
          manually.
        * Removed CryptedFileKeyring migration support. To maintain an existing
          CryptedFileKeyring, one must first upgrade to 0.9.2 or later and access the
          keyring before upgrading to 1.0 to retain the existing keyring.
        * File System backends now create files without group and world permissions.
          Fixes #67.
        
        ------
        0.10.1
        ------
        
        * Merged 0.9.3 to include fix for #75.
        
        ----
        0.10
        ----
        
        * Add support for using `Keyczar <http://www.keyczar.org/>`_ to encrypt
          keyrings. Keyczar is "an open source cryptographic toolkit designed to make
          it easier and safer for developers to use cryptography in their
          applications."
        * Added support for storing keyrings on Google Docs or any other filesystem
          supported by pyfilesystem.
        * Fixed issue in Gnome Keyring when unicode is passed as the service name,
          username, or password.
        * Tweaked SecretService code to pass unicode to DBus, as unicode is the
          preferred format.
        * Issue #71 - Fixed logic in CryptedFileKeyring.
        * Unencrypted keyring file will be saved with user read/write (and not group
          or world read/write).
        
        -----
        0.9.3
        -----
        
        * Ensure migration is run when get_password is called. Fixes #75. Thanks to
          Marc Deslauriers for reporting the bug and supplying the patch.
        
        -----
        0.9.2
        -----
        
        * Keyring 0.9.1 introduced a whole different storage format for the
          CryptedFileKeyring, but this introduced some potential compatibility issues.
          This release incorporates the security updates but reverts to the INI file
          format for storage, only encrypting the passwords and leaving the service
          and usernames in plaintext. Subsequent releases may incorporate a new
          keyring to implement a whole-file encrypted version. Fixes #64.
        * The CryptedFileKeyring now requires simplejson for Python 2.5 clients.
        
        -----
        0.9.1
        -----
        
        * Fix for issue where SecretServiceBackend.set_password would raise a
          UnicodeError on Python 3 or when a unicode password was provided on Python
          2.
        * CryptedFileKeyring now uses PBKDF2 to derive the key from the user's
          password and a random hash. The IV is chosen randomly as well. All the
          stored passwords are encrypted at once. Any keyrings using the old format
          will be automatically converted to the new format (but will no longer be
          compatible with 0.9 and earlier). The user's password is no longer limited
          to 32 characters. PyCrypto 2.5 or greater is now required for this keyring.
        
        ---
        0.9
        ---
        
        * Add support for GTK 3 and secret service D-Bus. Fixes #52.
        * Issue #60 - Use correct method for decoding.
        
        -----
        0.8.1
        -----
        
        * Fix regression in keyring lib on Windows XP where the LOCALAPPDATA
          environment variable is not present.
        
        ---
        0.8
        ---
        
        * Mac OS X keyring backend now uses subprocess calls to the `security`
          command instead of calling the API, which with the latest updates, no
          longer allows Python to invoke from a virtualenv. Fixes issue #13.
        * When using file-based storage, the keyring files are no longer stored
          in the user's home directory, but are instead stored in platform-friendly
          locations (`%localappdata%\Python Keyring` on Windows and according to
          the freedesktop.org Base Dir Specification
          (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/python_keyring` or `$HOME/.local/share/python_keyring`)
          on other operating systems). This fixes #21.
        
        *Backward Compatibility Notice*
        
        Due to the new storage location for file-based keyrings, keyring 0.8
        supports backward compatibility by automatically moving the password
        files to the updated location. In general, users can upgrade to 0.8 and
        continue to operate normally. Any applications that customize the storage
        location or make assumptions about the storage location will need to take
        this change into consideration. Additionally, after upgrading to 0.8,
        it is not possible to downgrade to 0.7 without manually moving
        configuration files. In 1.0, the backward compatibilty
        will be removed.
        
        -----
        0.7.1
        -----
        
        * Removed non-ASCII characters from README and CHANGES docs (required by
          distutils if we're to include them in the long_description). Fixes #55.
        
        ---
        0.7
        ---
        
        * Python 3 is now supported. All tests now pass under Python 3.2 on
          Windows and Linux (although Linux backend support is limited). Fixes #28.
        * Extension modules on Mac and Windows replaced by pure-Python ctypes
          implementations. Thanks to Jerome Laheurte.
        * WinVaultKeyring now supports multiple passwords for the same service. Fixes
          #47.
        * Most of the tests don't require user interaction anymore.
        * Entries stored in Gnome Keyring appears now with a meaningful name if you try
          to browser your keyring (for ex. with Seahorse)
        * Tests from Gnome Keyring no longer pollute the user own keyring.
        * `keyring.util.escape` now accepts only unicode strings. Don't try to encode
          strings passed to it.

        -----
        0.6.1
        -----
        
        * Gnome keyring should not be used if there is no DISPLAY or if the dbus is
          not around (https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpadlib/+bug/752282).
        
        ---
        0.6
        ---
        
        * Added `keyring.http` for facilitating HTTP Auth using keyring.
        
        * Add a utility to access the keyring from the command line.

        -----
        
        * Remove a spurious KDE debug message when using KWallet
        
        * Fix a bug that caused an exception if the user canceled the KWallet dialog
